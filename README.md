# flask_project01
First web project using flask framework

To use the project, download it and then enter the root folder where all the files are using cmd. After that give the command "python -m venv venv" and then "venv\Scripts\activate" and finally "pip install -r requirements.txt". Now just start using the "flask run" command.
