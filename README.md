# flask_project01
First web project using flask framework

To use the project, download it and then enter the root folder where all the files are using cmd. After that give the command "python -m venv venv" and then "venv\Scripts\activate" and finally "pip install -r requirements.txt". Now just start using the "flask run" command.

To log into the system use the "admin" credentials in the username and password. To access other users, use the same username in the password, for example we have the "emusk" credential
